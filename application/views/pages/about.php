               <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>S.T.E.M. Classes influenced me to create <img src="assets/images/banner-sm.png" class="logo" alt="@yemgunter small logo"/></p>
                <p>I am a foodie. The science of the perfect combinations of water, natural flavors and glucose makes thirst quenching drinks.</p>
                 <p>As a natural opportunist, I combine simple accounting principles with science and started my lemonade stand.</p>
                <p>Check out my <a href="gallery">gallery</a> page to see how I, with local venue sponsorships, brought smiles and treats to my community during SXSW 2019.</p>
