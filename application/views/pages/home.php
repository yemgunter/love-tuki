                <h2>Austin Lemonade Day</h2>
                <p>Lemonade Day is a free, fun, experiential learning program that teaches youth how to start, own and operate their own business</p>
                <p>It began in Houston, Texas in 2007. Since then it has grown to 1 million kids across North America - including me!</p>
                <p>I first registered Tuki's Teas and Treats with Austin Lemonade Day in Fall of 2018.</p>
                <p>Being a part of Austin's growing youth involvement has helped me learn customer service, basic business accounting and community partnership building. </p>
                <p>Go to my <a href="gallery">gallery</a> page to see how I, with local venue sponsorships, brought smiles and treats to my community during SXSW 2019.</p>
